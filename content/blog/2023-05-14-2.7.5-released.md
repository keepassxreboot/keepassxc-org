Today, we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.7.5** with a bunch of bug fixes and performance improvements. This version fixes
three separate crashes that were found with the support of our active community members. Additionally, we fixed several
areas in the code that were causing significant slow downs when databases had more than a thousand entries.

This release brings several popular feature requests including a menu option to temporarily allow screen capture (Windows & macOS),
an improved layout to the HTML export, improved KeePassXC logos and icons, and increasing the max TOTP step to 24 hours.
