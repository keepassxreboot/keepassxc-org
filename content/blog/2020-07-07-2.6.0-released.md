Today we have released the long awaited **KeePassXC 2.6.0**. This release is the culmination of a year's worth of 
effort from across our development team and dedicated contributors. With 2.6.0 comes a complete overhaul of the
user interface with custom themes (both light and dark), icons, and exciting features. We now have comprehensive 
password reports, including Have I Been Pwned password checks to find breached passwords. In addition, the YubiKey
and OnlyKey integration is vastly improved with support for up to four keys plugged in simultaneously. Pictures are 
worth a thousand words, so here are some screenshots! Check out the rest [over here]({{< baseurl >}}screenshots).
