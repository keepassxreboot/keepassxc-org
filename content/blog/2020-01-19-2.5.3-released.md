Today we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.5.3**, the third maintenance update for KeePassXC 2.5.

The update adds support for the new Chromium-based Edge browser to KeePassXC-Browser and comes
with a critical fix for a bug that may inadvertently scramble a database's master
key after removing a YubiKey from a KDBX 3.1 database.

Additional changes include fixes for a number of application crashes, enhanced
URL matching in KeePassXC-Browser, and other stability improvements.

The new release can be downloaded from our
[downloads page]({{< baseurl >}}download), our
[Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~phoerious/+archive/ubuntu/keepassxc/),
