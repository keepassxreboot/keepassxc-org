After a short beta phase, we are proud to release **KeePassXC 2.3.0**.

With this release, we reach another major milestone on our journey to providing
you with the best and most secure cross-platform password management
tool. KeePassXC 2.3 comes with a lot of new features and bug fixes which our
users have been waiting for long enough.

Among the highlights of the release are KDBX 4.0, Argon2 as a new key derivation
function, SSH agent integration, a new entry preview panel and an all-new
browser plugin, called KeePassXC-Browser, which replaces the old
KeePassHTTP-based plugins.

Thanks to our active community, KeePassXC also received a great
number of new and updated translations and is now available in 32 languages,
with even more being under development on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/keepassxc/keepassxc/)!
