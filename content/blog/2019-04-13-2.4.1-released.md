We are happy to announce **KeePassXC 2.4.1**, the first maintenance release of the 2.4 series!

The new release fixes several bugs introduced in the previous feature release,
including a case of possible data loss when unsafe saves were disabled on
macOS and an issue with reading legacy keyfiles preventing the user from
opening their database.

<!--more-->

Other notable changes are a crash fix when editing the master key, macOS Mojave
dark mode enhancements, various KeeShare fixes, restoration of the previous
Ctrl+C behavior for copying entries while searching, as well as tab order and
navigation / UX improvements.

We also fixed a compilation error with older GCC versions, so PPA users on Ubuntu
Xenial (and Trusty for that matter) are able to enjoy the new release as well.

The new release can be downloaded from our
[downloads page]({{< baseurl >}}download), our
[Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~phoerious/+archive/ubuntu/keepassxc/),
and [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/keepassxc/).
