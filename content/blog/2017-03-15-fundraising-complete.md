The KeePassXC team wants to thank all who have contributed to our Authenticode certificate fundraising. With your
support and additional generous funding from the [Linux Fund](http://www.linuxfund.org/) (thank you especially,
Ilan), we managed to collect all the money needed for purchasing a four-year Authenticode certificate.

The certificate has already been ordered and will be used to sign our next Windows and OS X releases. This will allow
you to easily verify authenticity and integrity of our binary release and prevents warnings about potentially untrusted
software during installation on both platforms. It also allows you to run KeePassXC on systems with a high security
policy which prevents execution of unsigned applications (e.g. AppLocker).

We will of course continue to ship our GPG signatures in addition to the new signed binaries.
