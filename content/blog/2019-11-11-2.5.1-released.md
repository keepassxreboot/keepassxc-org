Today we are releasing the first maintenance update for the 2.5 baseline, **KeePassXC 2.5.1**.

This update comes with fixes to reported issues after our initial release. Thank you for your patience
and detailed reports that allowed us to fix these problems. Overall this release brings significant 
stability and usability improvements to KeePassXC. Most notably the file hash checking has been reduced
to every 30 seconds to eliminate lag with large databases.

Additionally, we provided several macOS related fixes including the ability to having Apple notarize our release:
