Today, we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.7.6** with a few bug fixes and enhancements. This version fixes a crash on 
macOS that occurred on exit. We also improved the visual display when dragging entries to move/copy, Quick Unlock 
is now automatically activated when unlocking for Auto-Type or Browser access, and the Auto-Type button and shortcut
key will be disabled when Auto-Type is turned off for the entry or group.
