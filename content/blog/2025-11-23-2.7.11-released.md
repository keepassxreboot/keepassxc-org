## ANSSI Security Visa for KeePassXC 2.7.9

On 17 November 2025, KeePassXC (Version 2.7.9 for Windows 10) has been awarded a security Visa by the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) for a First-level Security Certification (CSPN) with report No. ANSSI-CSPN-2025/16. The certification was sponsored by the agency and is valid for three years.

The CSPN security Visa certifies that the product was tested to comply with ANSSI first-level security standards. The certification is recognised by French authorities and internationally by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). More information, the audit report, and the certificate can be found on the [ANSSI website](https://cyber.gouv.fr/produits-certifies/keepassxc-version-279). We have also created a dedicated page [listing all previous security reviews]({{< baseurl >}}audits/) of KeePassXC. We will keep the page updated with any future audits and certifications.

KeePassXC 2.7.9 can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/releases/tag/2.7.9). However, if you want to enjoy the latest features, we recommend you read on and download our new release: KeePassXC 2.7.11! ;-)

## New Release: KeePassXC 2.7.11

The new KeePassXC 2.7.11 release contains a large number of bug fixes and enhancements. The most notable new features are: support for more file types in the inline attachment viewer (images, HTML, and Markdown), the ability to edit text file attachments, a new database merge confirmation dialog, support for groups in KeeShare, and an option for automatically generating passwords in new entries. We also fixed longstanding issues where the main window would not restore its previous geometry when starting in the tray, or KeePassXC not releasing secure input mode on macOS. The new version also comes with a brand-new Liquid Glass icon and new platform-specific Window and Help menus on macOS.
