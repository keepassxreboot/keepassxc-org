We're thrilled to announce the release of **KeePassXC version 2.7.7**. This update brings several exciting features and enhancements that will improve your workflow and integration with modern authentication services. Let's dive into the major highlights:

## Passkeys Support

This release delivers the official implementation of Passkeys for KeePassXC! This feature is a year in the making and uses the existing browser integration service to both store and use Passkeys for authentication. A special thank you to [Ortham](https://github.com/Ortham) for providing an extremely comprehensive standards, security, and privacy review of our implementation prior to release. If you haven't heard of Passkeys yet, they are an alternative to passwords that are incredibly secure and privacy preserving. Read more [about Passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) and also [read our documentation](/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide.html#_passkeys).

## Import Wizard

Migrating from another password manager? We have you covered! KeePassXC now has the ability to import your data from the latest versions of **1Password** and **Bitwarden**. We have also introduced a better import workflow, improved CSV handling, and the ability to import into an existing database.

## Simplified Database Unlock

The last major improvement is a much more streamlined database unlock experience. We have removed all extra fields unless you use them. Hardware keys, such as Yubikey and OnlyKey, are now detected automatically upon being plugged into your computer. A handy refresh button is provided in case you need to unlock your OnlyKey or are using an NFC reader. Using a key file? No problem, just click `I have a key file` to show the standard key file picker.
