    <h3>General</h3>
    <ul uk-accordion="multiple: true">
        <li>
            <a id="faq-keepassx" href="#faq-keepassx" class="uk-accordion-title">Why KeePassXC instead of KeePassX?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>KeePassX is no longer developed - as announced on the KeePassX website on 2021-12-09. Our decision to fork KeePassX
                    was made some years prior, due to a sharp decline in code frequency at the time, combined with our wish to provide
                    you with everything you love about KeePassX plus many new <a href="/#project">features and bugfixes</a>.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a id="faq-keepass" href="#faq-keepass" class="uk-accordion-title">Why KeePassXC instead of KeePass?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>KeePass is a very proven and feature-rich password manager and there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it.
                    However, it is written in C# and therefore requires Microsoft's .NET platform.
                    On systems other than Windows, you can run KeePass using the Mono runtime libraries, but you won't get
                    the native look and feel which you are used to.</p>
                <p>KeePassXC, on the other hand, is developed in C++ and runs natively on Linux, macOS and Windows giving you the
                    best-possible platform integration.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a id="faq-format" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-format">Which password database formats are compatible with KeePassXC?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>KeePassXC currently uses the KeePass 2.x (.kdbx) password database formats KDBX 3.1 and KDBX 4 as its native file formats.
                    KDBX 2 files can be opened, but will be upgraded to a newer format. KeePass 1.x (.kdb) databases can be imported into
                    a .kdbx file, but saving a .kdbx file as .kdb would be lossy, and saving to .kdb is not supported by KeePassXC.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a id="faq-cloudsync" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-cloudsync">Why is there no cloud synchronization feature built into KeePassXC?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Cloud synchronization with Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, ownCloud, Nextcloud etc. can be easily accomplished by
                    simply storing your KeePassXC database inside your shared cloud folder and letting your synchronization service of
                    choice do the rest. We prefer this approach, because it is simple, not tied to a specific cloud provider and keeps
                    the complexity of our code low.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a id="faq-general-plugins" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-general-plugins">Does KeePassXC support (KeePass2) plugins?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>No, KeePassXC does not support plugins at the moment and probably never will. KeePassXC already provides many of the features that
                    need third-party plugins in KeePass2, so for most things you don't even need plugins, nor should you ever want them.
                    Plugins are inherently dangerous. Many KeePass2 plugins are barely maintained (if at all), some have known vulnerabilities that
                    have never been (and probably never will be) fixed, and none of them are as thoroughly tested and reviewed as we test and review
                    code that goes into our main application. We find that encouraging users to install untested (and often quickly-abandoned) third-party
                    plugins is inherently incompatible with the security demands of a password manager.</p>

                <p>If you really need external functionality not
                    available in KeePassXC, you can look for "plugins" that use the KeePassXC-Browser API, which is a much more secure way of sharing
                    passwords with third-party applications than loading those applications as plugins directly into KeePassXC.</p>

            <a id="faq-general-wordlist" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-general-wordlist">How can I add additional word lists to the passphrase generator?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>You can add additional word lists to the passphrase generator by copying the word list file to the
                    <code>share/wordlists</code> folder inside your KeePassXC installation directory and then restarting KeePassXC.</p>

                <p>On Linux, the default install location is <code>/usr/share/keepassxc</code>, 
                    on macOS it is <code>/Applications/KeePassXC.app/Contents/Resources</code> and 
                    on Windows <code>C:\Program Files\KeePassXC</code> (or <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\KeePassXC</code> for 32-bit).</p>

            <a id="faq-security-kdbx4" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-security-kdbx4">How can I migrate my database to KDBX 4?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>In the <em>Database</em> application menu, select <em>Database security...</em>. Select the <em>Encryption Settings</em> tab

                Doesn't this undermine any advantage of two-factor authentication?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Yes. But only if you store them in the same database as your password. We believe that storing both together
                    can still be more secure than not using 2FA at all, but to maximize the security gain from using 2FA,
                    you should always store TOTP secrets in a separate database, secured with a different password, possibly even on a different computer.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a id="faq-security-why-pm" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-security-why-pm">Why would I use a password manager? Isn't it totally insecure to use
                    one password for everything?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Password reuse and simple, easy-to-guess passwords are the biggest problems when using online services.
                    If one service gets compromised (either by guessing your password or by exploiting a security vulnerability
                    in the service's infrastructure), an attacker may gain access to all of your other accounts.</p>

                <p>But using different passwords for all websites is difficult without a way of storing them somewhere safe.
                    Especially with arbitrary password rules for various services, it becomes increasingly hard to use both strong
                    and diverse passwords. KeePassXC stores your passwords for you in an encrypted database file, so you only
                    need to remember one master password. Of course, the security of all your services depends on the strength
                    of your master password now, but with a sufficiently strong password, the password database should be
                    infeasible to crack.</p>

                <p>The database is encrypted with either the industry-standard AES256 or the Twofish
                    block cipher and the master password is strengthened by a configurable number of key transformations
                    to harden it against brute force attacks. Additionally, you can use a key file filled with an arbitrary
                    number of random bytes or a YubiKey to further enhance your master key.</p>

            <a id="faq-audit" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-audit">Has KeePassXC ever had an external security audit?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Yes, an audit was conducted by Zaur Molotnikov, an independent security consultant, and completed on January 19, 2023. This
                    audit was conducted free of charge to the KeePassXC Team and the findings and writeup were reviewed for correctness.

                </p>

                <p>Keep in mind that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An audit is not 100% proof that software is safe and secure. Some flaws can be overlooked even by the best auditors.</li>
                    <li>An audit is valid only for a “snapshot” of the code. If new code is added, new vulnerabilities can be introduced.</li>
                    <li>Audits are expensive and time consuming, you can consult with <a href="https://ostif.org/" target="_blank">OSTIF</a> or 
                        <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/" target="_blank">OTF</a> for funding additional KeePassXC audits.</li>

            <a id="faq-security-network" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-security-network">I see that KeePassXC requires network access. What for?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>KeePassXC needs network access for downloading website icons (favicons) for password entries. This feature is optional
                    and opt-in. KeePassXC will never access any network resource without your explicit prior consent. If you
                    don't use this feature, you may also compile KeePassXC without any networking code (see
                    next question).</p>

            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Yes, you can compile KeePassXC without any networking code. Simply configure CMake with <code>-DWITH_XC_NETWORKING=OFF</code>
                    (see <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/wiki/Building-KeePassXC">Building KeePassXC</a>).</p>

            <a id="faq-appsnap-run-appimage" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-appsnap-run-appimage">How do I execute an AppImage?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>The AppImage is a self-contained executable archive, comparable to an Android APK or macOS DMG. To execute
                    it, simply give the downloaded <code>*.AppImage</code> file execution permissions:</p>
                {{< highlight bash >}}chmod +x ./KeePassXC-*.AppImage{{< / highlight >}}
                <p>After that you can execute it either from the terminal or by double clicking it just like any other program.</p>

            <a id="faq-appsnap-support" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-appsnap-support">What systems can I use the AppImage or Snap package on?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>The AppImage should run out of the box on almost any moderately modern Linux distribution. The Snap is supported on all
                    systems, which have <code>snapd</code> installed. This is primarily Ubuntu, but also Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE,
                    Arch Linux and many more. For a full list and more information visit <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">snapcraft.io</a>. Note
                    that not all systems that can run Snaps also support confinement via AppArmor.</p>

            <a id="faq-appsnap-appimage-cli" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-appsnap-appimage-cli">How do I use the KeePassXC CLI tool with the AppImage?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Starting with version 2.2.2, you can run the KeePassXC CLI tool from the AppImage by executing it with the
                    <code>cli</code> argument:</p>
                {{< highlight bash >}}./KeePassXC-*.AppImage cli{{< / highlight >}}

            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Since Snaps and AppImages are self-contained and mostly isolated from your system, they cannot know what
                    theme you are currently running. This is a known issue with both Snaps and AppImages.</p>

            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Due to a Snap's isolation and security settings, you must manually enable the <code>raw-usb</code> interface in order
                    to use your YubiKey. Issue the following command from a terminal to enable this interface:</p>
                {{< highlight bash >}}sudo snap connect "keepassxc:raw-usb" "core:raw-usb"{{< / highlight >}}

            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Due to Snap's isolation and security settings, you cannot access any files outside your home directory.
                Furthermore, you cannot access any hidden files within your home directory. The only exception is mounted
                    USB drives, but you must type in <code>/media/</code> into the file open dialog to see them.</p>
                <p>If you still cannot access the <code>/media/</code> directory then you may need to enable this permission in the Ubuntu store.
                    Open the Ubuntu store, choose the KeePassXC app, and click permissions.</p>

    <h3>Key Files</h3>

        <li>
            <a id="faq-keyfile-howto" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-keyfile-howto">What is a key file and how can I get one?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>A key file is a file containing random bytes that can be added to your master key for additional security.
                    Think of it as a really complicated and long password that is read from a file, so you don't have to remember
                    or type it into your master password field. You can basically use any file you want as a key file, but <strong>it
                    is of <em>utmost</em> importance that a) the file never changes and b) it actually contains unpredictable data.</strong> If the file
                    changes, it is as if you forgot your password and you will lose access to your database.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if the data
                    is not random enough, then it's a really bad password. So, for instance, a static and never-changing holiday picture
                    is okay, your personal notes file is not. Generally, we recommend you let KeePassXC generate a dedicated key file for you.
                    Go to <em>Database -&gt; Database Settings -&gt; Security</em>. There you click on <em>Add Key File</em> and then
                    on <em>Generate</em>. Select the location where to save the key file, make sure the path to the new file
                    is inserted into the Key File field, and save your database. Don't forget to keep a backup of the key file in
                    a safe place!</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a id="faq-keyfile-security" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-keyfile-security">How secure is a key file and how can I sync it to other devices?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>A key file is only as secure as you keep it. It is basically a password that you've written down. As a general
                    rule, you should never use a key file without an actual password, because it is harder to keep your key file
                    secret than a memorized password that only you know. However, a key file can be very strong additional
                    protection if kept separately from the database file, such as on an external thumb drive. If you sync your database
                    via a cloud provider (Dropbox, Google Drive, Nextcloud, &hellip;), you should only sync the KDBX file and distribute the key file to
                    your computers by different means, such as said thumb drive.</p>
                <p>But whatever you do, <strong>keep a backup in a safe location!</strong>
                    If you lose your key file, you lose your database. Keep in mind that USB thumb drives are notoriously unreliable,
                    break easily, or get lost. If you can afford it, we recommend you use a hardware token such as a YubiKey or OnlyKey
                    instead of a key file (see next section). Such a key adds an even greater amount of security, but with fewer potential pitfalls.</p>

            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Yes and no. No, because technically speaking, KeePassXC is not a service and therefore does not use "authentication". Instead,
                    you are "decrypting" your database, which is different from "authentication". Nonetheless, you can improve the security of your database
                    by use of a YubiKey in a slightly different way. KeePassXC generates a challenge and uses the YubiKey's response to this challenge to
                    enhance the encryption key of your database.</p>
                <p>So in a sense, it makes your password stronger, but technically it doesn't qualify as a
                    separate second factor, since this is not an authentication scheme and also because the expected response doesn't change every time you
                    try to decrypt your database. It does, however, change every time you save your database. Be aware, however, that the previous version of your
                    database can still be decrypted with the old challenge/response (but no other version prior to that and no future version either).</p>

            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>To use a YubiKey or OnlyKey for securing your KeePassXC database, you have to configure one of your YubiKey / OnlyKey slots
                    for HMAC-SHA1 Challenge Response mode (see this
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Qe9Z-kOH0">video</a>
                    for how to do this). Once your YubiKey (or OnlyKey, you got the point&hellip;) is set up, open your database in KeePassXC, go to
                    <em>File / Change master key</em>, enable <em>Challenge Response</em> and then save the database.<br>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> Always make a copy of the secret that is programmed into your YubiKey while
                    you configure it for HMAC-SHA1 and store it in a secure location. If you lose or brick the key or accidentally
                    reprogram it with a different secret, you will permanently lose access to your database!</p>

                    I have no such file when using KeePassXC?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Our implementation differs from how KeeChallenge handles YubiKeys. KeeChallenge uses the HMAC secret
                    directly to enhance the database. To make this work, they need to store the secret in a side-car file,
                    encrypted with the response of a challenge-response pair that is calculated ahead of time. In KeePassXC,
                    we do not require any knowledge of the HMAC secret. We use the database's master seed (a random byte string that is part of your database)
                    as challenge and then use the response to encrypt the database. That way we do not need an extra file and also gain
                    the advantage that the required response changes every time you save the database, which resembles
                    actual two-factor authentication more closely.</p>

            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Due to the fact that our YubiKey implementation differs from KeeChallenge's, they are inherently incompatible
                    (see question above). If you need compatibility between KeePass2 and KeePassXC, you cannot use YubiKeys

            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>Both FIDO-U2F and TOTP require a dynamic component (i.e., a counter or timestamp) for successful authentication.
                    This is perfect for authenticating at an online service, but doesn't work for an offline database which needs
                    to be encrypted with a fixed key. HMAC-SHA1, on the other hand, can be computed ahead of time
                    as it only needs a fixed secret and no dynamic component of any kind.</p>

                location. This can be an analog paper copy, but since the YubiKey personalization tool allows you to
                    program a custom secret into the key, you may as well program a second key with the same secret.</p>

                <p>If you are using <em>GNOME Keyring</em>, it is known to be buggy and the SSH Agent implementation fairly incomplete
                    prior to release <strong>3.27.92</strong>. You are encouraged to use OpenSSH <code>ssh-agent</code> if you are stuck with
                    an older version.</p>
                <p>Known limitations of older versions include no support for Ed25519 keys, no support for confirm-on-use and incorrect
                    implementation of the agent protocol causing protocol errors.</p>

            <a id="faq-ssh-agent-auth-errors" class="uk-accordion-title" href="#faq-ssh-agent-auth-errors">I'm getting a "Too many authentication failures" error, what shall I do?</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>SSH will try all available identity files in sequence when connecting to a server. If you export many SSH
                    keys at a time, you'll very likely experience a <em>"Received disconnect from {port}: Too many
                    authentication failures"</em> error. To solve this issue, you'll have to tell SSH which identity file to
                    use. Either use the <code>-i</code> command line option or the <code>IdentityFile</code> directive in your
                    OpenSSH config file (<code>~/.ssh/config</code>) to pass the path to the respective private key file.</p>
                <p>If you use the <code>IdentityFile</code> directive, you likely want to use the <code>IdentitiesOnly</code>
                    directive, too. The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys#Managing_multiple_keys">
                    Arch Linux wiki</a> has a generic guide on how to manage multiple keys.</p>
                <p>If you prefer storing your private key inside your database using an attachment, you can still do so.
                    Instead of letting the <code>IdentityFile</code> directive point to a private key file, let it point to
                    your public key file. The SSH Agent will use the provided information to select the correct private key.</p>

            <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>KeePassXC on Windows can be used with <a href="KeePassXC_UserGuide.html#_openssh_agent_and_pageant_on_windows" target="_blank">Pageant</a>
                    or with Windows OpenSSH.<br> Git for Windows supports both options since version
                    <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.33.0.windows.1" target="_blank">2.33.0</a>.</p>
                <p>You will be prompted during installation of Git for Windows to pick the option you prefer – depending on
                    your Windows version and whether PuTTY is installed.</p>
                <p>The MSYS2 ssh-agent socket offered by Git for Windows's bundled OpenSSH is
                    <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/4681" target="_blank"><strong>not supported</strong></a>.</p>
                <p>If you did not choose Windows OpenSSH during Git installation you can still do the following to make Git (Bash) use Windows OpenSSH:
                    Prepend the path to Windows OpenSSH to the <code>PATH</code> variable inside the Git Bash, e.g.
                    <code>export PATH="/c/Windows/System32/OpenSSH:$HOME/bin:$PATH"</code> or use the <code>GIT_SSH_COMMAND</code> environment variable
                    (<code>core.sshCommand</code> in the Git configuration file) to override the path to the SSH binary specifically for Git.</p>

                <p>For KeePassXC, porting it properly to mobile platforms would require a full rewrite.
                    You may be able to compile KeePassXC for the mobile OS of your choice, but it isn't at all optimized
                    for mobile screen sizes and form factors, let alone multi-touch input. We also don't see any advantage in
                    providing a mobile version of KeePassXC when there are already excellent options.</p>
