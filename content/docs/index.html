    <h3>General</h3>
    <dl class="uk-description-list">
        <dt id="faq-keepassx"><a href="#faq-keepassx">Why KeePassXC instead of KeePassX?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>KeePassX is an amazing password manager, but hasn't seen much active development for quite a while. Many
                good pull requests were never merged and the original project is missing some features which users
                can expect from a modern password manager. Hence, we decided to fork KeePassX to continue its
                development
                and provide you with everything you love about KeePassX plus many new <a href="/project">features and bugfixes</a>.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-keepass"><a href="#faq-keepass">Why KeePassXC instead of KeePass?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>KeePass is a very proven and feature-rich password manager and there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it.
                However, it is written in C# and therefore requires Microsoft's .NET platform.
                On systems other than Windows, you can run KeePass using the Mono runtime libraries, but you won't get
                the native look and feel which you are used to.</p>
            <p>KeePassXC, on the other hand, is developed in C++ and runs natively on all platforms giving you the
                best-possible platform integration.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-format"><a href="#faq-format">Which password database formats are compatible with KeePassXC?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>KeePassXC currently uses the KeePass 2.x (.kdbx) password database format as its native file format in versions
                3.1 and 4. Database files in version 2 can be opened, but will be upgraded to a newer format.
                KeePass 1.x (.kdb) databases can be imported into a .kdbx file, but this process is one-way.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-cloudsync"><a href="#faq-cloudsync">Why is there no cloud synchronization feature built into KeePassXC?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Cloud synchronization with Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, ownCloud, Nextcloud etc. can be easily accomplished by
                simply storing your KeePassXC database inside your shared cloud folder and letting your desktop synchronization client
                do the rest. We prefer this approach, because it is simple, not tied to a specific cloud provider and keeps
                the complexity of our code low.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-general-plugins"><a href="#faq-general-plugins">Does KeePassXC support (KeePass2) plugins?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>No, KeePassXC does not support plugins at the moment and probably never will. KeePassXC already provides many of the features that
                need third-party plugins in KeePass2 out of the box, so for most things you don't even need plugins, nor should you ever want them.
                Plugins are inherently dangerous. Many KeePass2 plugins are barely maintained (if at all), some have known vulnerabilities that
                have never been (and probably never will be) fixed, and none of them are as thoroughly tested and reviewed as we test and review
                code that goes into our main application. We find that encouraging users to install untested (and often quickly-abandoned) third-party
                plugins is inherently incompatible with the security demands of a password manager.</p>

            <p>If you really need external functionality not
                available in KeePassXC, you can look for "plugins" that use the KeePassXC-Browser API, which is a much  more secure way of sharing
                passwords with third-party applications than loading those applications as plugins directly into KeePassXC.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-general-wordlist"><a href="#faq-general-wordlist">How can I add additional word lists to the passphrase generator?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>You can add additional word lists to the passphrase generator by copying the word list file to the <code>share/wordlists</code>
                folder inside your KeePassXC installation directory and then restarting KeePassXC.</p>

            <p>On Linux, the default install location is <code>/usr/share/keepassxc</code>, on macOS it's
            <code>/Applications/KeePassXC.app/Contents/Resources</code> and on Windows <code>C:\Program Files\KeePassXC</code>
                (or <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\KeePassXC</code> for 32-bit).</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <dl class="uk-description-list">
        <dt id="faq-security-kdbx4"><a href="#faq-security-kdbx4">How can I migrate my database to KDBX 4?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>In the <em>Database</em> application menu, select <em>Database security...</em>. Select the <em>Encryption Settings</em> tab
                and choose <em>KDBX 4.0 (recommended)</em>. Press OK and save the database.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-security-totp"><a href="#faq-security-totp">KeePassXC allows me to store my TOTP secrets. Doesn't this alleviate any advantage of
                two-factor authentication?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Yes. But only if you store them in the same database as your password. We believe that storing both together
                can still be more secure than not using 2FA at all, but to maximize the security gain from using 2FA,
                you should always store TOTP secrets in a separate database, secured with a different password, possibly
                even on a different computer.</p>
        </dd>


        <dt id="faq-security-why-pm"><a href="#faq-security-why-pm">Why would I use a password manager? Isn't it totally insecure to use
                one password for everything?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Password reuse and simple, easy-to-guess passwords are the biggest problems when using online services.
                If one service gets compromised (either by guessing your password or by exploiting a security vulnerability
                in the service's infrastructure), an attacker may gain access to all of your other accounts.</p>

            <p>But using different passwords for all websites is difficult without a way of storing them somewhere safe.
                Especially with arbitrary password rules for various services, it becomes increasingly hard to use both strong
                and diverse passwords. KeePassXC stores your passwords for you in an encrypted database file, so you only
                need to remember one master password. Of course, the security of all your services depends on the strength
                of your master password now, but with a sufficiently strong password, the password database should be
                infeasible to crack.</p>

            <p>The database is encrypted with either the industry-standard AES256 or the Twofish
                block cipher and the master password is strengthened by a configurable number of key transformations
                to harden it against brute force attacks. Additionally, you can use a key file filled with an arbitrary
                number of random bytes or a YubiKey to further enhance your master key.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-audit"><a href="#faq-audit">Has KeePassXC ever had an external security audit? Why not?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>At the time of writing, No.
            Having a third-party security audit comes with a considerable price and at the moment, KeePassXC is a purely community-driven project.
            There is no company or business behind KeePassXC and we have other expenses. We receive some donations, but those are not enough to finance an audit.
                Maybe you can beg <a href="https://ostif.org/">OSTIF</a> or <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/">OTF</a> for funding a KeePassXC audit.</p>

            <p>In any case, keep in mind that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An audit is not a 100% proof that a software is safe and secure. Some flaws can be overlooked even by the best auditors.</li>
                <li>An audit is valid only for a “snapshot” of the code. If new code is added, new vulnerabilities can be introduced.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-security-network"><a href="#faq-security-network">I see that KeePassXC requires network access. What for?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>KeePassXC needs network access for downloading website icons (favicons) for password entries and for
                providing KeePassHTTP-compatible browser extensions with access to your database. Both features are optional
                and opt-in. KeePassXC will never access any network resource without your explicit prior consent. If you
                don't use either of these features, you may also compile KeePassXC without any networking code (see
                next question).</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-security-no-network"><a href="#faq-security-no-network">Can I get a KeePassXC version without any networking code?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Yes, you can compile KeePassXC without any networking code. Simply configure CMake with <code>-DWITH_XC_NETWORKING=OFF</code>
                (see <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/wiki/Building-KeePassXC">Building KeePassXC</a>).</p>

    <h3>AppImage and Snap package</h3>
    <dl class="uk-description-list">
        <dt id="faq-appsnap-run-appimage"><a href="#faq-appsnap-run-appimage">How do I execute an AppImage?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>The AppImage is a self-contained executable archive, comparable to an Android APK or macOS DMG. To execute
                it, simply give the downloaded <code>*.AppImage</code> file execution permissions:</p>
            {{< highlight bash >}}chmod +x ./KeePassXC-*.AppImage{{< / highlight >}}
            <p>After that you can execute it either from the terminal or by double clicking it just like any other program.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-appsnap-support"><a href="#faq-appsnap-support">What systems can I use the AppImage or Snap package on?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>The AppImage should run out of the box on almost any moderately modern Linux distribution. The Snap is supported on all
                systems, which have <code>snapd</code> installed. This is primarily Ubuntu, but also Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE,
                Arch Linux and many more. For a full list and more information visit <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">snapcraft.io</a>. Note
                that not all systems that can run Snaps also support confinement via AppArmor.</p>

        <dt id="faq-appsnap-appimage-cli"><a href="#faq-appsnap-appimage-cli">How do I use the KeePassXC CLI tool with the AppImage?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Starting with version 2.2.2, you can run the KeePassXC CLI tool from the AppImage by executing it with the
                <code>cli</code> argument:</p>
            {{< highlight bash >}}./KeePassXC-*.AppImage cli{{< / highlight >}}
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-appsnap-theme"><a href="#faq-appsnap-theme">Why doesn't my theme work?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Since Snaps and AppImages are self-contained and mostly isolated from your system, they cannot know what
                theme you are currently running. This is a known issue with both Snaps and AppImages.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-appsnap-yubikey"><a href="#faq-appsnap-yubikey">How do I get my YubiKey to work with the Snap?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Due to a Snap's isolation and security settings, you must manually enable the <code>raw-usb</code> interface in order
                to use your YubiKey. Issue the following command from a terminal to enable this interface:</p>
            {{< highlight bash >}}sudo snap connect "keepassxc:raw-usb" "core:raw-usb"{{< / highlight >}}
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-appsnap-homedir"><a href="#faq-appsnap-homedir">Why can't I see anything outside my home directory?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Due to Snap's isolation and security settings, you cannot access any files outside your home directory.
            Furthermore, you cannot access any hidden files within your home directory. The only exception is mounted
                USB drives, but you must type in <code>/media/</code> into the file open dialog to see them.</p>
            <p>If you still cannot access the <code>/media/</code> directory then you may need to enable this permission in the Ubuntu store.
                Open the Ubuntu store, choose the KeePassXC app, and click permissions.</p>

    <h3>Key Files</h3>
    <dl class="uk-description-list">
        <dt id="faq-keyfile-howto"><a href="#faq-keyfile-howto">What is a key file and how can I get one?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>A key file is a file containing random bytes that can be added to your master key for additional security.
                Think of it as a really complicated and long password that is read from a file, so you don't have to remember
                or type it into your master password field. You can basically use any file you want as a key file, but <strong>it
                is of <em>utmost</em> importance that a) the file never changes and b) it actually contains unpredictable data.</strong> If the file
                changes, it is as if you forgot your password and you will lose access to your database.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if the data
                is not random enough, then it's a really bad password. So, for instance, a static and never-changing holiday picture
                is okay, your personal notes file is not. Generally, we recommend you let KeePassXC generate a dedicated key file for you.
                Go to <em>Database -&gt; Database Settings -&gt; Security</em>. There you click on <em>Add Key File</em> and then
                on <em>Generate</em>. Select the location where to save the key file, make sure the path to the new file
                is inserted into the Key File field, and save your database. Don't forget to keep a backup of the key file in
                a safe place!</p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="faq-keyfile-security"><a href="#faq-keyfile-security">How secure is a key file and how can I sync it to other devices?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>A key file is only as secure as you keep it. It is basically a password that you've written down. As a general
                rule, you should never use a key file without an actual password, because it is harder to keep your key file
                secret than a memorized password that only you know. However, a key file can be very strong additional
                protection if kept separately from the database file, such as on an external thumb drive. If you sync your database
                via a cloud provider (Dropbox, Google Drive, Nextcloud, &hellip;), you should only sync the KDBX file and distribute the key file to
                your computers by different means, such as said thumb drive.</p>
            <p>But whatever you do, <strong>keep a backup in a safe location!</strong>
                If you lose your key file, you lose your database. Keep in mind that USB thumb drives are notoriously unreliable,
                break easily, or get lost. If you can afford it, we recommend you use a hardware token such as a YubiKey or OnlyKey
                instead of a key file (see next section). Such a key adds an even greater amount of security, but with fewer potential pitfalls.</p>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>YubiKey / OnlyKey</h3>
    <dl class="uk-description-list">
        <dt id="faq-yubikey-2fa"><a href="#faq-yubikey-2fa">Does KeePassXC support two-factor authentication (2FA) with YubiKeys or OnlyKeys?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Yes and no. No, because technically speaking, KeePassXC is not a service and therefore does not use "authentication". Instead,
                you are "decrypting" your database, which is different from "authentication". Nonetheless, you can improve the security of your database
                by use of a YubiKey in a slightly different way. KeePassXC generates a challenge and uses the YubiKey's response to this challenge to
                enhance the encryption key of your database.</p>
            <p>So in a sense, it makes your password stronger, but technically it doesn't qualify as a
                separate second factor, since this is not an authentication scheme and also because the expected response doesn't change every time you
                try to decrypt your database. It does, however, change every time you save your database. Be aware, however, that the previous version of your
                database can still be decrypted with the old challenge/response (but no other version prior to that and no future version either).</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-yubikey-howto"><a href="#faq-yubikey-howto">How do I configure my YubiKey / OnlyKey for use with KeePassXC?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>To use a YubiKey or OnlyKey for securing your KeePassXC database, you have to configure one of your YubiKey / OnlyKey slots
                for HMAC-SHA1 Challenge Response mode (see this
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Qe9Z-kOH0">video</a>
                for how to do this). Once your YubiKey (or OnlyKey, you got the point&hellip;) is set up, open your database in KeePassXC, go to
                <em>File / Change master key</em>, enable <em>Challenge Response</em> and then save the database.<br>
                <strong>Important:</strong> Always make a copy of the secret that is programmed into your YubiKey while
                you configure it for HMAC-SHA1 and store it in a secure location. If you lose or brick the key or accidentally
                reprogram it with a different secret, you will permanently lose access to your database!</p>

        <dt id="faq-yubikey-no-extra-file"><a href="#faq-yubikey-no-extra-file">When I use KeeChallenge with KeePass2, it creates an extra file. Why do
                I have no such file when using KeePassXC?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Our implementation differs from how KeeChallenge handles YubiKeys. KeeChallenge uses the HMAC secret
                directly to enhance the database. To make this work, they need to store the secret in a side-car file,
                encrypted with the response of a challenge-response pair that is calculated ahead of time. In KeePassXC,
                we do not require any knowledge of the HMAC secret. We use the database's master seed (a random byte string that is part of your database)
                as challenge and then use the response to encrypt the database. That way we do not need an extra file and also gain
                the advantage that the required response changes every time you save the database, which resembles
                actual two-factor authentication more closely.</p>

        <dd>
            <p>Due to the fact that our YubiKey implementation differs from KeeChallenge's, they are inherently incompatible
                (see question above). If you need compatibility between KeePass2 and KeePassXC, you cannot use YubiKeys

            <p>Both FIDO-U2F and TOTP require a dynamic component (i.e., a counter or timestamp) for successful authentication.
                This is perfect for authenticating at an online service, but doesn't work for an offline database which needs
                to be encrypted with a fixed key. HMAC-SHA1, on the other hand, can be computed ahead of time
                as it only needs a fixed secret and no dynamic component of any kind.</p>

                program a custom secret into the key, you may as well program a second key with the same secret.</p>

            <p>SSH will try all available identity files in sequence when connecting to a server. If you export many SSH

                OpenSSH config file (<code>~/.ssh/config</code>) to pass the path to the respective private key file.</p>
            <p>If you use the <code>IdentityFile</code> directive, you likely want to use the <code>IdentitiesOnly</code>
                directive, too. The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys#Managing_multiple_keys">

                Instead of letting the <code>IdentityFile</code> directive point to a private key file, let it point to
                your public key file. The SSH Agent will use the provided information to select the correct private key.</p>
