    <div class="info">
        <h6>A note about KeePassHTTP</h6>
        <p>KeePassHTTP is not a highly secure protocol and has certain flaws which allow an attacker to decrypt your
            passwords if they manage to intercept communication between a KeePassHTTP server and KeePassHTTP-Connector over a
            network connection (see <a href="https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/issues/258">here</a> and <a
                    href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/147">here</a>). KeePassXC therefore strictly
            limits communication between itself and the browser plugin to your local computer. As long as your computer is
            not compromised, your passwords are fairly safe that way, but use it at your own risk!
        <p><strong>As of KeePassXC 2.3</strong>, we deprecated KeePassHTTP in favor of KeePassXC-Browser. If you are still
            using KeePassHTTP, please <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/keepassxc-browser-migration/">migrate to KeePassXC-Browser</a>.
            Support for KeePassHTTP will be removed in the future.
