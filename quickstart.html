    <h3>Quickstart Guide for KeePassXC</h3>
    <p>This procedure gets KeePassXC running on your computer with browser integration,
        using the pre-built binaries available for <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download">download</a>
        from our website.

    <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> KeePassXC saves your passwords securely.
        When you double-click a URL in KeePassXC, it launches your default browser to that URL.
        With browser integration configured, KeePassXC automatically enters
        username/password credentials into web page fields.

    <h4>Installing and starting KeePassXC</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download">Download the native installer</a> and install

        <li>Open the KeePassXC application.
        <li>Create a new database and give it a master key that's used to unlock the database file.

            for all your websites, programs, etc.
        <li>Create a few entries â€“ enter the username, password, URL, and optionally notes about the entry.
