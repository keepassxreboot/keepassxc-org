    <h4>Answers</h4>

    <h5>General</h5>
    <dl>
        <dt id="faq-keepassx"><a href="#faq-keepassx">Why KeePassXC instead of KeePassX?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            KeePassX is an amazing password manager, but hasn't seen much active development for quite a while. Many
            good pull requests were never merged and the original project is missing some features which users
            can expect from a modern password manager. Hence, we decided to fork KeePassX to continue its development
            and provide you with everything you love about KeePassX plus many new <a href="/project">features and bugfixes</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-keepass"><a href="#faq-keepass">Why KeePassXC instead of KeePass?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            KeePass is a very proven and feature-rich password manager and there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it.
            However, it is written in C# and therefore requires Microsoft's .NET platform.
            On systems other than Windows, you can run KeePass using the Mono runtime libraries, but you won't get
            the native look and feel which you are used to.<br>
            KeePassXC, on the other hand, is developed in C++ and runs natively on all platforms giving you the best-possible
            platform integration.
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-format"><a href="#faq-format">Which password database formats are compatible with KeePassXC?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            KeePassXC currently uses the KeePass 2.x (.kdbx) password database format as its native file format.
            It can also import KeePass 1.x (.kdb) databases, but this is a one-way process.
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-kdbx4"><a href="#faq-kdbx4">Why doesn't KeePassXC support KDBX4?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            We are working on it! There is a <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/148">pull request</a>,
            but dotting the i's and crossing the t's will take some time.
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-cloudsync"><a href="#faq-cloudsync">Why is there no cloud synchronization feature built into KeePassXC?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Cloud synchronization with Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Nextcloud etc. can be easily accomplished by
            simply storing your KeePassXC database inside your shared cloud folder and letting your desktop synchronization client
            do the rest. We prefer this approach, because it is simple, not tied to a specific cloud provider and keeps
            the complexity of our code low.
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-general-plugins"><a href="#faq-general-plugins">Does KeePassXC support (KeePass2) plugins?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            No, KeePassXC does not support plugins at the moment. We are thinking about providing some kind of
            plugin infrastructure or external API in the future, but cannot specify how it will work or when it will
            be ready.
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-general-wordlist"><a href="#faq-general-wordlist">How can I add additional word lists to the passphrase generator?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            You can add additional word lists to the passphrase generator by copying the word list file to the <code>share/wordlists</code>
            folder inside your KeePassXC installation directory and then restarting KeePassXC.<br>
            On Linux, the default install location is <code>/usr/share/keepassxc</code>, on macOS it's
            <code>/Applications/KeePassXC.app/Contents/Resources</code> and on Windows <code>C:\Program Files\KeePassXC</code>
            (or <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\KeePassXC</code> for 32-bit).

    <h5>Security</h5>
    <dl>
        <dt id="faq-security-totp"><a href="#faq-security-totp">KeePassXC allows me to store my TOTP secrets. Doesn't this alleviate any advantage of
            two-factor authentication?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Yes. But only if you store them in the same database as your password. We believe that storing both together
            can still be more secure than not using 2FA at all, but to maximize the security gain from using 2FA,
            you should always store TOTP secrets in a separate database, secured with a different password, possibly
            even on a different computer.
        </dd>


        <dt id="faq-security-why-pm"><a href="#faq-security-why-pm">Why would I use a password manager? Isn't it totally insecure to use
            one password for everything?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Password reuse and simple, easy-to-guess passwords are the biggest problems when using online services.
            If one service gets compromised (either by guessing your password or by exploiting a security vulnerability
            in the service's infrastructure), an attacker may gain access to all of your other accounts.
            But using different passwords for all websites is difficult without a way of storing them somewhere safe.
            Especially with arbitrary password rules for various services, it becomes increasingly hard to use both strong
            and diverse passwords. KeePassXC stores your passwords for you in an encrypted database file, so you only
            need to remember one master password. Of course, the security of all your services depends on the strength
            of your master password now, but with a sufficiently strong password, the password database should be
            infeasible to crack. The database is encrypted with either the industry-standard AES256 or the Twofish
            block cipher and the master password is strengthened by a configurable number of key transformations
            to harden it against brute force attacks. Additionally, you can use a key file filled with an arbitrary
            number of random bytes or a YubiKey to further enhance your master key.
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-audit"><a href="#faq-audit">Has KeePassXC ever had an external security audit? Why not?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            At the time of writing, No.
            Having a third-party security audit comes with a considerable price and at the moment, KeePassXC is a purely community-driven project.
            There is no company or business behind KeePassXC and we have other expenses. We receive some donations, but those are not enough to finance an audit.
            Maybe you can beg <a href="https://ostif.org/">OSTIF</a> or <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/">OTF</a> for funding a KeePassXC audit.
            <br>
            In any case, keep in mind that:
            <ul>
                <li>An audit is not a 100% proof that a software is safe and secure. Some flaws can be overlooked even by the best auditors.</li>
                <li>An audit is valid only for a “snapshot” of the code. If new code is added, new vulnerabilities can be introduced.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-security-network"><a href="#faq-security-network">I see that KeePassXC requires network access. What for?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            KeePassXC needs network access for downloading website icons (favicons) for password entries and for
            providing KeePassHTTP-compatible browser extensions with access to your database. Both features are optional
            and opt-in. KeePassXC will never access any network resource without your explicit prior consent. If you
            don't use either of these features, you may also compile KeePassXC without any networking code (see
            next question).
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-security-no-network"><a href="#faq-security-no-network">Can I get a KeePassXC version without any networking code?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Yes, you can compile KeePassXC without any networking code. Simply configure CMake with <code>-DWITH_XC_HTTP=OFF</code>
            (see <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/wiki/Building-KeePassXC">Building KeePassXC</a>).

    <h5>AppImage and Snap package</h5>
    <dl>
        <dt id="faq-appsnap-run-appimage"><a href="#faq-appsnap-run-appimage">How do I execute an AppImage?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            The AppImage is a self-contained executable archive, comparable to an Android APK or macOS DMG. To execute
            it, simply give the downloaded <code>*.AppImage</code> file execution permissions:
            <pre><code>chmod +x ./KeePassXC-*.AppImage</code></pre>
            After that you can execute it either from the terminal or by double clicking it just like any other program.
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-appsnap-support"><a href="#faq-appsnap-support">What systems can I use the AppImage or Snap package on?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            The AppImage should run out of the box on almost any moderately modern Linux distribution. The Snap is supported on all
            systems, which have <code>snapd</code> installed. This is primarily Ubuntu, but also Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE,
            Arch Linux and many more. For a full list and more information visit <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">snapcraft.io</a>. Note
            that not all systems that can run Snaps also support confinement via AppArmor.

        <dd>
            Starting with version 2.2.2, you can run the KeePassXC CLI tool from the AppImage by executing it with the
            <code>cli</code> argument:
            <pre><code>./KeePassXC-*.AppImage cli</code></pre>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-appsnap-theme"><a href="#faq-appsnap-theme">Why doesn't my theme work?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Since Snaps and AppImages are self-contained and mostly isolated from your system, they cannot know what
            theme you are currently running. This is a known issue with both Snaps and AppImages.

        <dt id="faq-appsnap-yubikey"><a href="#faq-appsnap-yubikey">How do I get my YubiKey to work with the Snap?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Due to a Snap's isolation and security settings, you must manually enable the <code>raw-usb</code> interface in order
            to use your YubiKey. Issue the following command from a terminal to enable this interface:
            <pre><code>sudo snap connect keepassxc:raw-usb core:raw-usb</code></pre>
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-appsnap-homedir"><a href="#faq-appsnap-homedir">Why can't I see anything outside my home directory?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Due to Snap's isolation and security settings, you cannot access any files outside your home directory.
            Furthermore, you cannot access any hidden files within your home directory. The only exception is mounted
            USB drives, but you must type in <code>/media/</code> into the file open dialog to see them.

    <h5>YubiKey</h5>
    <dl>
        <dt id="faq-yubikey-2fa"><a href="#faq-yubikey-2fa">Does KeePassXC support two-factor authentication (2FA) with YubiKeys?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Yes and no. KeePassXC supports YubiKeys for securing a database, but strictly speaking, it's not two-factor
            authentication. KeePassXC generates a challenge and uses the YubiKey's response to this challenge to
            enhance the encryption key of your database. So in a sense, it makes your password stronger,
            but technically it doesn't qualify as a separate second factor, since the expected response doesn't change every time
            you try to decrypt your database. It does, however, change every time you save your database.
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-yubikey-howto"><a href="#faq-yubikey-howto">How do I configure my YubiKey for use with KeePassXC?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            To use a YubiKey for securing your KeePassXC database, you have to configure one of your YubiKey slots
            for HMAC-SHA1 Challenge Response mode (see this
            <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/personalization-tools/challenge-response/">video</a>
            for how to do this). Once your YubiKey is set up, open your database in KeePassXC, go to
            <em>File / Change master key</em>, enable <em>Challenge Response</em> and then save the database.<br>
            <strong>Important:</strong> Always make a copy of the secret that is programmed into your YubiKey while
            you configure it for HMAC-SHA1 and store it in a secure location. If you lose or brick the key or accidentally
            reprogram it with a different secret, you will permanently lose access to your database!
        </dd>

        <dt id="faq-yubikey-no-extra-file"><a href="#faq-yubikey-no-extra-file">When I use KeeChallenge with KeePass2, it creates an extra file. Why do
            I have no such file when using KeePassXC?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Our implementation differs from how KeeChallenge handles YubiKeys. KeeChallenge uses the HMAC secret
            directly to enhance the database. To make this work, they need to store the secret in a side-car file,
            encrypted with the response of a challenge-response pair that is calculated ahead of time. In KeePassXC,
            we do not require any knowledge of the HMAC secret. We use the database's master key as challenge
            and then use the response to encrypt the database. That way we do not need an extra file and also gain
            the advantage that the required response changes every time you save the database, which resembles
            actual two-factor authentication more closely.

        <dt id="faq-yubikey-incompatible"><a href="#faq-yubikey-incompatible">When I secure my database in KeePass2 with a YubiKey, I can't open it in
            KeePassXC (or vice versa), why?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Due to the fact that our YubiKey implementation differs from KeeChallenge's, they are inherently incompatible
            (see question above). If you need compatibility between KeePass2 and KeePassXC, you cannot use YubiKeys
            at the moment.

        <dd>
            Both FIDO-U2F and TOTP require a dynamic component (i.e., a counter or timestamp) for successful authentication.
            This is perfect for authenticating at an online service, but doesn't work for an offline database which needs
            to be encrypted with a fixed key. HMAC-SHA1, on the other hand, can be computed ahead of time
            as it only needs a fixed secret and no dynamic component of any kind.

        <dt id="faq-yubikey-otp"><a href="#faq-yubikey-otp">But the feature list says KeePassXC supports TOTP. I am confused.</a></dt>
        <dd>
            We do support generation of timed one-time passwords (TOTP), but do not (and cannot) support it for securing
            your KeePassXC database. KeePassXC allows you to store TOTP secrets for online services inside a database
            and generates the corresponding timed one-time passwords for you. For TOTP, see also the question
            <a href="#faq-security-totp">KeePassXC allows me to store my TOTP secrets. Doesn't this alleviate any advantage of

        <dd>
            You should always make a copy of the HMAC secret that is stored on the YubiKey and keep it in a secure
            location. This can be an analog paper copy, but since the YubiKey personalization tool allows you to
            program a custom secret into the key, you may as well program a second key with the same secret.

        <dt id="faq-browser"><a href="#faq-browser">Does KeePassXC support browser extensions?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Yes. KeePassXC supports KeePassHTTP-Connector as a legacy browser integration and a newer extension KeePassXC-Browser. While
            KeePassHTTP-Connector still uses KeePassHTTP (which is going to be deprecated in the future), KeePassXC-Browser handles the
            connection with KeePassXC through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging">native messaging</a>.
            Both extensions are WebExtension compatible and also work with every Chromium-based browser.
            You can download KeePassXC-Browser for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/">Mozilla Firefox</a> and
            <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepassxc-browser/iopaggbpplllidnfmcghoonnokmjoicf">Google Chrome / Chromium / Vivaldi</a>.

        <dd>
            You can enable Browser Integration (KeePassXC-Browser) or Legacy Browser Integration (KeePassHTTP-Connector) from KeePassXC settings.
            A guide for KeePassHTTP-Connector is available <a href="https://github.com/smorks/keepasshttp-connector/blob/master/documentation/KeePassHttp-Connector.md">
            here</a>. See the page <a href="https://keepassxc.org/docs/keepassxc-browser-migration.md">How to connect KeePassXC-Browser with KeePassXC</a> for more
            detailed information for the new Browser Integration.

        <dt id="faq-browser-diff"><a href="#faq-browser-diff">How the new browser integration differs from the old?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Older TCP socket based KeePassHTTP has been replaced with native messaging, and traffic is encrypted with libsodium's
            <a href="https://download.libsodium.org/doc/public-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption.html">Public-key authenticated encryption</a>.
            Native messaging ensures that KeePassXC-Browser can only communicate with a specified application. Also, it is possible to use multiple browsers
            simultaneously. For more detailed info, please see the project's <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc-browser">GitHub</a> page.

    <h5>Platform-specific</h5>
    <dl>
        <dt id="faq-autotype"><a href="#faq-autotype">Is Auto-Type supported on macOS and Windows?</a></dt>
        <dd>Yes, Auto-Type works on all three supported platforms.</dd>

        <dt id="faq-platform-mobile"><a href="#faq-platform-mobile">Does KeePassXC work on mobile phones? If not, which app would you recommend?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            No, KeePassXC only works on desktop systems. Porting it properly to mobile platforms would require a full rewrite.
            You may be able to compile it for the mobile OS of your choice, but KeePassXC isn't at all optimized
            for mobile screen sizes and form factors, let alone multi-touch input. We also don't see any advantage in
            providing a mobile version of KeePassXC when there are excellent alternatives, already. For Android we
            recommend <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android">KeePass2Android</a>
            and for iOS <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minikeepass/id451661808?mt=8">MiniKeePass</a> or
            <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keepass-touch/id966759076?mt=8">KeePass Touch</a>.<br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> KeePass2Android does support YubiKeys via NFC, but its challenge-response
            implementation is incompatible with KeePassXC at the moment. <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/1060">
            We are working on a solution, though.</a>

            or use certain shortcuts on KDE?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            This is a “feature” in KDE's platform theme. It automatically adds ampersand (&amp;) characters to on-screen text
            to allow you to trigger an action by pressing Alt+HOTKEY on your keyboard. Unfortunately, this “feature”
            causes more trouble than it does good. You can disable it by adding the following two lines to
            <code>~/.config/kdeglobals</code>:
            <pre><code>[Development]
AutoCheckAccelerators=false</code></pre>
            If you are like us and think this is a stupid feature, please consider voicing your concerns to the
            <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=337491">KDE guys</a>.

        <dd>
            This is a bug caused by <code>appmenu-qt5</code>.<br>
            You have 3 options:
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the <code>appmenu-qt5</code> package
                <li>Set the environment variable <code>UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=''</code>
                <li>Set the environment variable <code>QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=''</code>
            </ul>
            <strong>Note:</strong> When you choose the first or third option, KeePassXC will lose the Unity look and feel.
