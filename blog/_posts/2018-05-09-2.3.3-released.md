Today we announce the third 2.3 maintenance release **KeePassXC 2.3.3**.

This release fixes a crash that was introduced in KeePassXC 2.3.2.
The crash occurred when browser integration via proxy was enabled and
prevented the application from starting if the setting was enabled in
a previous version.
