Today we announce another 2.3 maintenance release with **KeePassXC 2.3.4**.

This release fixes a crash while downloading website favicons and brings
some minor improvements to the entry view, database merging, SSH agent
functionality, and browser integration.

With KeePassXC 2.3.4, we have also updated our PPA to ship a package for
the upcoming Ubuntu 18.10 Cosmic Cuttlefish, whereas 17.10 Artful Aardvark
has been discontinued.
