#### Note: we do not recommend using this release as it contains a couple of bugs

Today we are releasing the fifth 2.6 maintenance update, **KeePassXC 2.6.5**.

This version brings numerous backports from the develop branch to bring some of our exciting new
features into a stable release. Notable changes include showing the search bar even when hidden, 
showing a countdown when the clipboard contains data, retaining creation date when saving the database, 
and fixing numerous bugs. See more in the changelog after the break.
