We are happy to announce **KeePassXC 2.4.2**, the second maintenance release of the 2.4 series!

This release fixes several bugs and introduces a memory wiping feature that will
reduce the risk of secrets remaining in memory after a database is locked or being swapped to disk. Combined with
the existing restrictions on memory access by non-administrators, this feature
increases the security of KeePassXC.

<!--more-->

Other notable changes are fixes to entry editing, prevention of infinite save loops,
ability to open non-http url's, and preventing data loss when opening a database with
duplicated attachment binaries.

The new release can be downloaded from our
[downloads page]({{ site.baseurl }}/download), our
[Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~phoerious/+archive/ubuntu/keepassxc/),
and [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/keepassxc/).
