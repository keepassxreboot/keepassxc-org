Today we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.5.3**, the third maintenance update for KeePassXC 2.5.

The update adds support for the new Chromium-based Edge browser to KeePassXC-Browser and comes
with a critical fix for a bug that may inadvertently scramble a database's master
key after removing a YubiKey from a KDBX 3.1 database.

<!--more-->

Additional changes include fixes for a number of application crashes, enhanced
URL matching in KeePassXC-Browser, and other stability improvements.

The new release can be downloaded from our
[downloads page]({{ site.baseurl }}/download), our
[Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~phoerious/+archive/ubuntu/keepassxc/),
and [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/keepassxc/).

Please report any bugs you encounter at our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues).
We are also available on Matrix and IRC in case you have any other issues with the new release
(see [Contact](/team/#contact)).
