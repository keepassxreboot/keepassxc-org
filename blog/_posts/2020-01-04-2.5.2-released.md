Today we are releasing the second maintenance update for the 2.5 baseline, **KeePassXC 2.5.2**.

This update comes with additional fixes to reported issues after our initial release. Thank you for your 
patience and detailed reports that allowed us to fix these problems. Overall this release brings significant 
stability and usability improvements to KeePassXC. Most notably are fixes to crashes when the database is 
stored in a cloud storage service and resolving site sub-domain matching for the browser extension.

Additionally, we provided several macOS related fixes including support for Qt 5.14 and using a readable monospace
font for the password and notes fields.

[downloads page]({{ site.baseurl }}/download), our
[Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~phoerious/+archive/ubuntu/keepassxc/),
