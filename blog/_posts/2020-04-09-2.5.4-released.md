Today we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.5.4**, the fourth maintenance update for KeePassXC 2.5.

The update primarily resolves a compatibility issue with macOS 10.15.4 and 10.14.6. The most recent
macOS security patches changed the way code signatures are checked resulting in a KeePassXC crash at
startup. We published a quick workaround at the end of last month, for which we had to sacrifice
TouchID support in order allow you guys to continue using KeePassXC. This update ships with a full
resolution of the code signing issue and brings back TouchID.

A minor side effect of the new update is a changed bundle and App ID. This is not much of a
problem, but previously granted accessibility permissions for Auto-Type may have to be granted
again after installing this update. Permissions for the "old" version can be safely revoked.

To make this release all about code signing, we also retired SHA1 as our Windows Authenticode
signature hash algorithm and moved on to SHA256. PGP signatures have always been SHA256 and
remain unchanged.

On top of all that, we backported two small fixes from the development preview of our next
major release, which are listed in the changelog below.

The new release can be downloaded from our
[downloads page]({{ site.baseurl }}/download), our
[Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~phoerious/+archive/ubuntu/keepassxc/),
and [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/keepassxc/).

Please report any bugs you encounter at our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues).
We are also available on Matrix and IRC in case you have any other issues with the new release
(see [Contact](/team/#contact)).
