Today we are releasing the second 2.6 maintenance update, **KeePassXC 2.6.2**.

This update includes several major bug fixes and user interface improvements. A major improvement to the way
the browser integration prioritizes and handles URLs has been introduced. Additionally, the phantom scrollbar
has been fixed along with macOS theme improvements.

Notable additions in this release are an "Always on Top" mode, options to specify configuration file locations, 
and improved CSV import/export functionality.
