Today we are releasing the first 2.6 maintenance update, **KeePassXC 2.6.1**.

The update ships with a number of bug fixes and overall improvements. A large portion of the fixes concern
platform-specific quirks with the new user interface and predominantly target Linux distributions without
a standard KDE or Gnome desktop. Fixes include a workaround for vanishing icons experienced by users of the qt5ct
platform theme and wonky UI widgets on high-DPI screens with fractional scaling.

Notable additions in this release are a new menu entry for selective Auto-Type of usernames or passwords only,
as well as an API for retrieving TOTP codes via the browser extension.

The new release can be downloaded from our
[downloads page]({{ site.baseurl }}/download), our
[Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~phoerious/+archive/ubuntu/keepassxc/),
and [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/keepassxc/).

Please report any bugs you encounter at our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues).
