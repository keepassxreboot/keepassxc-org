After two beta releases, today we are proud to release **KeePassXC 2.4.0**!

With this release, we have streamlined our code, improved the user interface,
and added several new and exciting features. We have merged a total of 116 pull
requests that implemented 12 new features, resolved 28 bugs, and closed 73 issues.

Among the highlights of this release are a new database creation wizard, advanced
search, KeeShare database sharing and synchronization, update checks, OpenSSH for
Windows support, and a QR Code generator for TOTP.

Thanks to our active community, KeePassXC is now available in 40 languages!

With KeePassXC 2.4.0, we got rid of the EXE Windows installer in
favor of an MSI installer. The new MSI installer is generally equivalent
in functionality, though if you were using the EXE installer before,
you need to manually uninstall KeePassXC before installing the update.

Our macOS binaries now have a minimum requirement of macOS 10.12 (Sierra)
instead of 10.10 (Yosemite) as before. This is due to a new Qt version
which is required in order to provide you with support for the new Mojave
dark theme. KeePassXC itself will continue to run on older systems, but
would need to be recompiled for that specific macOS version from source.
