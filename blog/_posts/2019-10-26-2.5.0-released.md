A bit more than half a year has passed since the last major release of KeePassXC, so today we
are very proud to announce **KeePassXC 2.5.0**.

The new release comes with a large number of new features and improvements. A few key additions
that are worth highlighting are the ability to create a paper backup of your database for safe
storage of your credentials away from your computer, a brand-new database statistics panel, a redesigned
unlock dialog, a reworked entry panel, a function to download favicons for all your entries at once,
and username autocompletion based on known usernames from other entries.

<!--more-->

In addition to that, we can now import 1Password OpVault files and support the use
of the open-source OnlyKey hardware token as an alternative to YubiKeys.

KeePassXC on Linux can now also function as a credentials provider for libsecret-based clients
via the Freedesktop.org secret storage DBus API.

The CLI has also seen a great deal of work making it one of the (if not *the*) most complete and powerful
command line tools for managing KDBX password files. Besides an offline [HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
checker for finding out if your credentials have been compromised, you can now also use
your YubiKey for unlocking a database and start an interactive session in which you can issue
various commands to interact with your database. Further noteworty additions are new commands for
managing groups and a dry-run feature to preview changes before merging two databases.

With KeePassXC 2.5.0, we also end support for Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, which saw its official EOL in
April this year. Our AppImages are now built on Ubuntu 16.04 instead and our minimum supported
Qt version was moved from 5.2 to 5.5 accordingly, allowing us to use more modern features missing
in older releases of the Qt framework.

The new release can be downloaded from our
[downloads page]({{ site.baseurl }}/download), our
[Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~phoerious/+archive/ubuntu/keepassxc/),
and [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/keepassxc/).

Please report any bugs you encounter at our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues).
We are also available on Matrix and IRC in case you have any other issues with the new release
(see [Contact](/team/#contact)).
