A week has gone by since our last big feature release and today we announce
the first 2.3 maintenance release **KeePassXC 2.3.1**.

KeePassXC 2.3 came with a lot of new features and, not unexpectedly, also quite
a few new bugs, which we address in this new release.

<!--more-->

Most importantly, we fixed two critical issues where an automatic KDBX 4.0
upgrade or an accidentally unplugged YubiKey could strip a challenge-response key
when saving the database. KeePassXC now shows an error message when trying to
save a challenge-response-secured database without a YubiKey.

We also fixed a few platform-specific crashes, which weren't critical, but
definitely annoying, as well as a few minor regressions. Two of them being qtbase
translations not being loaded and the database tab order being mixed up after
restarting KeePassXC.

The new release can be downloaded from our
[downloads page](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/releases/tag/2.3.1)
on GitHub, our Ubuntu PPA, and Snapcraft.
