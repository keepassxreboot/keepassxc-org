    <h3>Donate</h3>
    <p>KeePassXC is free, but we have a few expenses such as the server our website is running on or renewal fees for
        software certificates for Windows and macOS.
    <p>It is much appreciated if you want to support us financially by donating a few bucks to cover our costs
        or perhaps simply buy us a beer which we can drink to you once in a while.

    <p>There are currently three ways you can donate money to us, which are:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://paypal.me/jbevendorff"> <i class="fa fa-paypal" aria-hidden="true"></i> PayPal</a>
            <p>Simply click the link and enter the amount you want to send us.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://flattr.com/@phoerious">
            <i class="fa fa-credit-card-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> Flattr</a>
            <p>Set up a subscription and we will (hopefully)  get a small fraction of it every 30 days.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i class="fa fa-bitcoin" aria-hidden="true"></i> Cryptocurrencies
