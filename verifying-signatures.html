    <p>By verifying the signatures of KeePassXC releases, you can prove the <strong>authenticity</strong> and
        <strong>integrity</strong> of the downloaded file.
        This guarantees that the file you just downloaded was originally created by the KeePassXC Team and that its
        contents haven't been tampered with on the way.</p>
    <p>A more detailed explanation is available in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/verifying-signatures/">Qubes-OS
        project documentation</a>.</p>

<div id="how-to-verify-signatures">
    <h4>Download Options</h4>
    <p>Every KeePassXC release is published in a variety of package formats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a <em>*.dmg</em> drag-and-drop installer for macOS</li>
        <li>an <em>*.exe</em> installer and a <em>*.zip</em> archive with binaries for Windows</li>
        <li>a self-contained executable <em>*.AppImage</em> for GNU/Linux.</li>
        <li>a <em>*.tar.xz</em> source tarball</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will need to download one of these to install on your machine.</p>

    <h4>Sidecar files</h4>
    <p>Each of these files has a related <em>*.sig</em> sidecar file that you
       should download as well. These contain a GPG <em>signature</em> created with
       one of our <em>release keys</em>. Signing the installable file with
       any other key will give a different signature, so you can use the signature
       and our public key to check the package file really came from us.</p>

    <p>Each release package also has a related <em>*.DIGEST</em> file. Grab that too.
       We will use it to check the package file has not been changed since it was
       uploaded to the KeePassXC website, and that it downloaded correctly.</p>

    <h4>Importing the Public Master Key</h4>
    <p>We will use the <code>gpg</code> program to check the signatures.
       Before you can do that you need to tell <code>gpg</code> about our public key,
       by <em>importing</em> it.
    </p>
    <p>The KeePassXC public key can be retrieved in any of the ways shown below:</p>

    <strong>From a specific keyserver</strong>
    <pre><code>gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0xBF5A669F2272CF4324C1FDA8CFB4C2166397D0D2</code></pre>

    <strong>Manual download from <a href="https://keepassxc.org/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc">our website</a> and import
        with gpg</strong>
    <pre><code>gpg --import ./keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc</code></pre>

    <strong>Fetch via gpg</strong>
    <pre><code>gpg --fetch-keys https://keepassxc.org/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc</code></pre>

    <strong>Manual download from the
        <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxreboot.github.io/blob/master/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc">KeePassXC
            website repository</a> and import with gpg</strong>
    <pre><code><strong>gpg --import ./keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc</strong></code></pre>

    <p>These are the fingerprints of the master key and the current signing sub keys:</p>
    <div><pre><code>pub   rsa4096/CFB4C2166397D0D2 2017-01-03 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = BF5A 669F 2272 CF43 24C1  FDA8 CFB4 C216 6397 D0D2
uid                 [  unknown  ] KeePassXC Release &lt;<span class="eobfs">release 'AT` keepassxc ^DOT' org</span>&gt;
sub   rsa2048/AFF235EEFB5A2517 2017-01-03 [S] [expires: 2019-01-03]
sub   rsa2048/D8538E98A26FD9C4 2017-01-03 [S] [expires: 2019-01-03]
sub   rsa2048/B7A66F03B59076A8 2017-01-03 [S] [expires: 2019-01-03]</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>Notice that we have a <em>master</em> key and some <em>sub</em> keys.
       The actual signatures are created with one of the <em>sub keys</em>.
       As the naming implies, they are closely related to one another -
       importing the master GPG key is sufficient for verifying signatures
       made with any of its sub keys.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have imported the key, you can decide whether you want to mark it as <em>trusted</em>.
       This is not strictly necessary for the checks we are making here. For more information, see the
       <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/verifying-signatures/">Qubes-OS project documentation</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Verifying Releases</h4>
    <p>You can verify the <strong>authenticity and integrity</strong> of a downloaded package from its detached
        signature by running the following command:</p>

    <pre><code>$ gpg --verify KeePassXC-$VERSION-x86_64.AppImage.sig
gpg: assuming signed data in 'KeePassXC-$VERSION-x86_64.AppImage'
gpg: Signature made Fri 17 Feb 2017 05:20:55 PM CET
gpg:                using RSA key C1E4CBA3AD78D3AFD894F9E0B7A66F03B59076A8
gpg: Good signature from "KeePassXC Release &lt;<span
                class="eobfs">release 'AT` keepassxc ^DOT' org</span>&gt;" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: BF5A 669F 2272 CF43 24C1  FDA8 CFB4 C216 6397 D0D2
     Subkey fingerprint: C1E4 CBA3 AD78 D3AF D894  F9E0 B7A6 6F03 B590 76A8</code></pre>
    <p>You want to see that "Good signature" line. It shows the .sig file must have been created from
       the AppImage file by the sub key with the fingerprint <code>C1E4CBA3AD78D3AFD894F9E0B7A66F03B59076A8</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The warning is there because in this example we have not taken the extra step of <em>trusting</em> that key.
    </p>
 
    <p>Remember the <em>*.DIGEST</em> file?
        You can verify the <strong>integrity</strong> of the package you downloaded with the following command:</p>

    <pre><code>$ shasum -a 256 -c KeePassXC-$VERSION-x86_64.AppImage.DIGEST
KeePassXC-$VERSION-x86_64.AppImage: OK</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>shasum</code> program recalculates the SHA-256 hash digest of the package file
       and compares it with the value in the <em>.DIGEST</em> file. If they match, this shows the package
       was downloaded without errors and has not been changed since the <em>.DIGEST</em> was created.</p>

    <h4>Verification fails!</h4>
    <p>Don't install the package. First, try downloading again and rechecking. If it is still not working,
       please let us know about the problem by opening an <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues">issue</a>.
