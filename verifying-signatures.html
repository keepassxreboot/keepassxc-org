    <p>By verifying the signatures of KeePassXC releases, you can prove the <strong>authenticity</strong> and
        <strong>integrity</strong> of the downloaded file.
        This guarantees that the file you just downloaded was originally created by the KeePassXC Team and that its
        contents haven't been tampered with on the way.</p>
    <p>A more detailed explanation is available in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/verifying-signatures/">Qubes-OS
        project documentation</a>.</p>

<div id="how-to-verify-signatures">
    <h4>Download Options</h4>
    <p>Every KeePassXC release is published in a variety of package formats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a <em>*.dmg</em> drag-and-drop installer for macOS</li>
        <li>an <em>*.msi</em> installer and a <em>*.zip</em> archive with binaries for Windows</li>
        <li>a self-contained executable <em>*.AppImage</em> for GNU/Linux.</li>
        <li>a <em>*.tar.xz</em> source tarball</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these package files has two related sidecar files, a <em>*.DIGEST</em> and a <em>*.sig</em> 
       that need to be downloaded to the same directory in order for verification to succeed.</p>

    <h4>Basic integrity check - Linux</h4>
    <p>Open a terminal window and change directory to the folder you downloaded the files to, e.g. <code>cd /home/username/Downloads</code></p>
    <p>The <em>*.DIGEST</em> file can be used to check your package downloaded correctly,
       with the following command:</p>

    <pre><code>$ shasum -a 256 -c KeePassXC-*-x86_64.AppImage.DIGEST
KeePassXC-*-x86_64.AppImage: OK</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>shasum</code> program recalculates the SHA-256 hash digest of the package file
       and compares it with the value in the <em>.DIGEST</em> file. If they match, this shows the package
       was downloaded without errors.</p>

   <h4>Basic integrity check - macOS</h4>
   <p>Open a terminal window and change directory to the folder you downloaded the files to, e.g. <code>cd /Users/username/Downloads</code></p>
   <p>The <em>*.DIGEST</em> file can be used to check your package downloaded correctly,
      with the following command:</p>

   <pre><code>$ shasum -a 256 -c KeePassXC-*.dmg.DIGEST
KeePassXC-*.dmg.AppImage: OK</code></pre>
   <p>The <code>shasum</code> program recalculates the SHA-256 hash digest of the package file
      and compares it with the value in the <em>.DIGEST</em> file. If they match, this shows the package
      was downloaded without errors.</p>

    <h4>Basic integrity check - Windows</h4>
    <p>Open a PowerShell window (WIN+R, type in <em>powershell</em>, press &lt;enter&gt;) and 
       change directory to the folder you downloaded the files to, e.g. <code>cd C:\Users\username\Downloads</code></p>
    <p>Copy/Paste the following command into the PowerShell window:</p>

    <pre><code>(Get-FileHash .\KeePassXC-*-Win64.msi).Hash -eq (Get-Content .\KeePassXC-*-Win64.msi.DIGEST).split(" ")[0].ToUpper()</code></pre>

    <p>You should see <code>True</code> appear, if not then the download is invalid or your files are not together.</p>

    <h4>Verifying Releases - Windows</h4>
    <p>The Windows installation file is protected by authenticode signature, this means that <strong>authenticity and integrity</strong> 
       checks are verified directly by Windows when you run the program.</p>
    <p>You should see the following dialog with <strong>DroidMonkey Apps, LLC</strong> as the verified publisher:</p>
    <p><img src="/images/KeePassXC_UAC.png"></p>

    <p>To verify a zip file, you must download and install <a href="https://www.gpg4win.org/" target="_blank">Gpg4win</a>.
        Then follow the verification directions below.</p>

    <h4>Checking integrity and <em>authenticity</em> - Linux, macOS, and Windows ZIP</h4>
    <p>A more thorough check can be made using the <em>*.sig</em> sidecar file.
       This contains an OpenPGP (GPG) <em>signature</em> created with one of our <em>release keys</em>.
       Signing files with any other key will give a different signature. Following these verification
       instructions will ensure the downloaded files really came from us.</p>

    <h4>Importing the Public Master Key</h4>
    <p>We will use the <code>gpg</code> program to check the signatures.
       Before you can do that you need to tell <code>gpg</code> about our public key,
       by <em>importing</em> it.</p>
    <p>On Windows and macOS you will need to install the <code>gpg</code> program. On Windows, we recommend 
        <a href="https://www.gpg4win.org/" target="_blank">Gpg4win</a>. On macOS we recommend 
        <a href="https://gpgtools.org/" target="_blank">GPG Tools</a> or gnupg installed via HomeBrew.</p>
    <p>The KeePassXC public key can be retrieved in any of the ways shown below:</p>

    <strong>From a specific keyserver</strong>
    <pre><code>gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys CFB4C2166397D0D2</code></pre>

    <strong>Manual download from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc">our website</a> and import
        with gpg</strong>
    <pre><code>gpg --import ./keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc</code></pre>

    <strong>Fetch via gpg</strong>
    <pre><code>gpg --fetch-keys https://keepassxc.org/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc</code></pre>

    <p>These are the fingerprints of the master key and the current signing sub keys:</p>
    <div><pre><code>pub   rsa4096 2017-01-03 [SC]
      BF5A669F2272CF4324C1FDA8CFB4C2166397D0D2
uid           [ultimate] KeePassXC Release &lt;<span class="eobfs">release 'AT` keepassxc ^DOT' org</span>&gt;
sub   rsa2048 2017-01-03 [S] [expires: 2021-01-07]

</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>Notice that we have a <em>master</em> key and some <em>sub</em> keys.
       The actual signatures are created with one of the <em>sub keys</em>.
       As the naming implies, they are closely related to one another -
       importing the master PGP key is sufficient for verifying signatures
       made with any of its sub keys.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have imported the key, you can decide whether you want to mark it as <em>trusted</em>.
       This is not strictly necessary for the checks we are making here. For more information, see the
       <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/verifying-signatures/">Qubes-OS project documentation</a>.

    <h4>Verifying Releases - Linux</h4>
    <p>You can verify the <strong>authenticity and integrity</strong> of a downloaded package from its detached
        signature by running the following command:</p>

    <pre><code>$ gpg --verify KeePassXC-*-x86_64.AppImage.sig

gpg: assuming signed data in 'KeePassXC-2.X.X-x86_64.AppImage'
gpg: Signature made Fri 17 Feb 2017 05:20:55 PM CET
gpg:                using RSA key C1E4CBA3AD78D3AFD894F9E0B7A66F03B59076A8
gpg: Good signature from "KeePassXC Release &lt;<span
                class="eobfs">release 'AT` keepassxc ^DOT' org</span>&gt;" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: BF5A 669F 2272 CF43 24C1  FDA8 CFB4 C216 6397 D0D2
     Subkey fingerprint: C1E4 CBA3 AD78 D3AF D894  F9E0 B7A6 6F03 B590 76A8</code></pre>
    <p>You want to see that "Good signature" line. It shows the .sig file must have been created from
       the AppImage file by the sub key with the fingerprint <code>C1E4CBA3AD78D3AFD894F9E0B7A66F03B59076A8</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The warning is there because in this example we have not taken the extra step of <em>trusting</em> that key.
    </p>

    <h4>Verifying Releases - macOS</h4>
    <p>You can verify the <strong>authenticity and integrity</strong> of a downloaded package from its detached
