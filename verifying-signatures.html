    <p>By verifying the signatures of KeePassXC releases, you can prove the <strong>authenticity</strong> and
        <strong>integrity</strong> of the downloaded file.
        This guarantees that the file you just downloaded was originally created by the KeePassXC Team and that its
        contents haven't been tampered with on the way.</p>
    <p>A more detailed explanation is available in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/verifying-signatures/">Qubes-OS
        project documentation</a>.</p>

    <h4>Download Options</h4>
    <p>Every KeePassXC release is published in a variety of formats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a <em>*.dmg</em> drag-and-drop installer for OS X</li>
        <li>an <em>*.exe</em> installer and a <em>*.zip</em> archive with binaries for Windows</li>
        <li>a self-contained executable <em>*.AppImage</em> for GNU/Linux.</li>
        <li>a <em>*.tar.xz</em> source tarball</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will select one of these to install on your machine.</p>

    <p>Each of these files has a related <em>*.sig</em> sidecar file that you
       should download as well. These contain a GPG <em>signature</em> created with
       one of our <em>release keys</em>. Signing the installable file with
       any other key will give a different signature, so you can use the signature
       and our public key to check the installable file really came from us.</p>

    <h4>Importing the Public Master Key</h4>
    <p>The KeePassXC public master key can be retrieved as follows:</p>

    <strong>From a specific keyserver</strong>
    <pre><code>gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0xBF5A669F2272CF4324C1FDA8CFB4C2166397D0D2</code></pre>

    <strong>Manual download from <a href="https://keepassxc.org/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc">our website</a> and import
        with gpg</strong>
    <pre><code>gpg --import ./keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc</code></pre>

    <strong>Fetch via gpg</strong>
    <pre><code>gpg --fetch-keys https://keepassxc.org/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc</code></pre>

    <p>These are the fingerprints of the master key and the current signing sub keys:</p>
    <div><pre><code>pub   rsa4096/CFB4C2166397D0D2 2017-01-03 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = BF5A 669F 2272 CF43 24C1  FDA8 CFB4 C216 6397 D0D2
uid                 [  unknown  ] KeePassXC Release &lt;<span class="eobfs">release 'AT` keepassxc ^DOT' org</span>&gt;
sub   rsa2048/AFF235EEFB5A2517 2017-01-03 [S] [expires: 2019-01-03]
sub   rsa2048/D8538E98A26FD9C4 2017-01-03 [S] [expires: 2019-01-03]
sub   rsa2048/B7A66F03B59076A8 2017-01-03 [S] [expires: 2019-01-03]</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The full public master key can also be downloaded from the
        <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxreboot.github.io/blob/master/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc">KeePassXC
            website repository</a>.</p>
    </p>
    <h4>Verifying Releases</h4>
    <p>You can verify the <strong>authenticity and integrity</strong> of a downloaded package from its detached
        signature by running the following command:</p>

    <pre><code>$ gpg --verify KeePassXC-$VERSION-x86_64.AppImage.sig
gpg: assuming signed data in 'KeePassXC-$VERSION-x86_64.AppImage'
gpg: Signature made Fri 17 Feb 2017 05:20:55 PM CET
gpg:                using RSA key C1E4CBA3AD78D3AFD894F9E0B7A66F03B59076A8
gpg: Good signature from "KeePassXC Release &lt;<span
                class="eobfs">release 'AT` keepassxc ^DOT' org</span>&gt;" [unknown]</code></pre>

    <p>In addition, there is a <em>*.DIGEST</em> file that contains the SHA-256 digest for a release file.
        You can verify the <strong>integrity</strong> of a package by checking its hash digest with the following command:</p>

    <pre><code>$ shasum -a 256 -c KeePassXC-$VERSION-x86_64.AppImage.DIGEST
KeePassXC-$VERSION-x86_64.AppImage: OK</code></pre>
</div>
